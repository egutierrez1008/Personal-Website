      <h4>Fall 2016 - A Tree House</h4>

        During her first semester as a high school freshman, Edna took an Art
        History course at Houston Community College. Over the course of the
        semester, the professor would show various historical artifacts from all
        over the world and talk about what the meaning behind them was. As a
        final exam, the professor decided to ask her students to create a
        project that they felt would represent them. Edna decided to construct a
        tree house out of materials she had at home. Such materials included: a
        chinese checkers board, an old table leg, a plastic water container, and
        some old crafts. All of these artifacts represented something meaningful
        in her life and her interests. In the end, she used it as a bird house
        for her pet birds!

        />
        In her sophomore year of high school, Edna was tasked with picking a
        historic architectural landmark in her World Geography Class and present
        it during a fair. She decided to present the Taj Mahal and in order to
        make the history and meaning behind the Taj Mahal more clear for her
        audience, she decided to construct a small model of the Taj Mahal out of
        everyday things. She used candles, christmas ornaments, cotton balls,
        paint, clay, wood, and cardboard.

      <h4>Spring 2023 - A Computer Bug</h4>
      <p class="art-summaries">

          src="computer-bug.png"
          alt="Moth symbolizing a computer bug coming out of a computer screen. The keys on the keyboard are in disarray."
        />
        While taking a sculpture class during her junior year, Edna was given a
        project where she had to use a laser cutter to create any sculpture.
        After thinking long and hard, she decided to create a sculpture that
        would showcase her interest in Computer Science. During her Introduction
        to Computer Science I, in her book, she remembered reading about a
        female computer scientists who had discovered an real bug in her
        computer that was actually causing errors in the computer. The terms
        "bug" and "de-bugging" always reminds her of this story, and she decided
        to create a model of what that would look like.

          alt="Wooden mario-bomb replica, made of prisms of varying size to give the impression of pixelation."
        />
        In her sculpture class, as a final exam, she was given a 18in x 5in x
        3in piece of wood and asked to make something out of it. Edna decided to
        have fun with this project and build a Bomb-omb from Mario that appeared
        to be pixelated. She then painted it and added a rope that made it seem
        like it had an actual fuse.
